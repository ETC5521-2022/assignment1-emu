# Expected findings

## What would be the notable finding when we comparing the consumption with production?

### Method

Data cleansing: Use `left_join()` function combine `consumption.csv` and
`capture_vs_farmed.csv` into one data set named `con_cap`. In order to
get the total production, add a new variable is the summation of
`Aquaculture production` and `Capture production`. We use the new data
set to do line plots and scatter plot for question one.

### Visualization and analysis

Figure \@ref(fig:worldconsumption) depicts the growing trend in world
seafood consumption from 1969 and 2018. The average yearly seafood
consumption for one person was 13.8kg, while it increased to 20kg in
recent time. Moreover, it is obviously that between 1990 and 1992, the
average seafood consumption decreased, mostly because of economic
problems in low-income nations such those in Africa, Latin America, the
Caribbean, and the Near East. This resulted in increased pressure on
many items' prices (Dumas, 1992). Seafood consumption has grown globally
as the crisis has subsided. Overall, this is consistent with our
assumption that seafood consumption would continue to rise.

The line plot \@ref(fig:production)of world yearly seafood production
shows an upward trend from 1969 to 2018. In 1970, the average production
of seafood is 118 million metric tons. While the production became 3
times greater in recent year. And the production decreasing period
happened same with the seafood consumption. We can make assumption that
there has a positive relationship between seafood consumption and
production.

```{r}
new_con <- consumption %>% 
    filter(Year >= 1969) %>%  
     select(-Code)

con_cap <-new_con %>% 
  left_join(captured_vs_farmed, by = c("Entity","Year")) %>% 
  rename(`seafood consumption(kg/capita/yr)` = `Fish, Seafood- Food supply quantity (kg/capita/yr) (FAO, 2020)`) %>% 
  select(-Code) 

con_cap$`Total production(metric tons)` = rowSums(con_cap[, c("Aquaculture production (metric tons)","Capture fisheries production (metric tons)")])

```

The bar plot \@ref(fig:contribution) shows the contributions of top 10
seafood producer by country. China is the largest contributor and
provide 40% seafood of the whole world in recent years. Indonesia and
India produce 11% and 5.6% respectively. It's intriguing to note that
except US produce 3% and Norway produce 1% of the seafood other major
producers are from Asia.

```{r scatter, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, preserve = TRUE, fig.pos = 'H', out.extra = "", fig.cap = "Relationship between seafood consumption and production"}
ggscatmat(avg_con, 
          columns = 2:ncol(avg_con)) 
```

To explore relationship between seafood consumption and seafood
production, we made a scatter matrix plot \@ref(fig:scatter). Since
seafood produce in two ways: aquaculture and capture, we add another two
variables `Aquaculture production` and `Capture production`to do the
scatter plot and try to find some interest between each variable. The
outcome demonstrates a strong positive correlation between each
variable. There is a significant linear positive relation between
average consumption and total production as we expected.The correlation
coefficient is 0.97 almost reach to 1. Moreover, the two methods used to
produce fish also has a positive linear relation.


### Summary and findings

1.  Upward trend for seafood production and consumption worldwide\
2.  Positive linear relationship between seafood production and
    consumption.
3.  Two seafood produce method: Aquaculture and capture have positive
    linear relation.
4.  Asia is the major continent to produce seafood and China produces
    the most seafood.



## Compare production of 7 different fish type. Which type of seafood contribute the most to meet the increasing demand?

### Method

We want to explore something interest when comparing fish type
production.

Use the `contribution.csv` data set and simplified the name of the
variables of 7 types of fish, since they are too long and not easy to
read. Add up each fish type as a total production variable. We wonder
which country contribute the most for each type of fish. In order to to
do that, I make a summary for average yearly production for each type of
fish by countries and then using max() function to find the answer.

To compare production of each type fish, I decide to use column plot.
Not only it can shows the trend but also easy to see the difference.
Categorize year to 4 decade and get the average production for each type
fish. Then use `pivot_longer()` to gather fish type into one column,
this is the preparation for making the column plot.

```{r}

new_pro<-production %>% 
  rename(`Pelagic Fish`=`Commodity Balances - Livestock and Fish Primary Equivalent - Pelagic Fish - 2763 - Production - 5510 - tonnes`, 
         Crustaceans = `Commodity Balances - Livestock and Fish Primary Equivalent - Crustaceans - 2765 - Production - 5510 - tonnes`, 
         Cephalopods = `Commodity Balances - Livestock and Fish Primary Equivalent - Cephalopods - 2766 - Production - 5510 - tonnes`, 
        `Demersal Fish`  = `Commodity Balances - Livestock and Fish Primary Equivalent - Demersal Fish - 2762 - Production - 5510 - tonnes`, 
        `Freshwater Fish` = `Commodity Balances - Livestock and Fish Primary Equivalent - Freshwater Fish - 2761 - Production - 5510 - tonnes`, 
          Molluscs = `Commodity Balances - Livestock and Fish Primary Equivalent - Molluscs, Other - 2767 - Production - 5510 - tonnes`, 
       `Marine Fish` = `Commodity Balances - Livestock and Fish Primary Equivalent - Marine Fish, Other - 2764 - Production - 5510 - tonnes`)


new_pro$`Total fish production`  = rowSums(new_pro[, c("Pelagic Fish", "Crustaceans","Cephalopods", "Demersal Fish", "Freshwater Fish", "Molluscs", "Marine Fish")])

```

```{r}
fish_type1 <- new_pro %>%  
  group_by(Entity) %>% 
  summarise(`avg Pelagic Fish` = mean(`Pelagic Fish`, na.rm= TRUE), 
            `avg Crustaceans` = mean(Crustaceans,  na.rm= TRUE), 
            `avg Cephalopods` = mean(Cephalopods,  na.rm= TRUE), 
            `avg Demersal Fish` = mean(`Demersal Fish`,  na.rm= TRUE), 
            `avg Freshwater Fish` = mean(`Freshwater Fish`,  na.rm= TRUE), 
            `avg Molluscs` = mean(Molluscs,  na.rm= TRUE),
            `avg Marine Fish` = mean(`Marine Fish`,  na.rm= TRUE)) %>%  
  na.omit() 

fish_type<-fish_type1[-c(126),]

#max(fish_type$`avg Marine Fish`)

#fish_type %>% filter(`avg Marine Fish` >= 6597212)

```

```{r fishtype, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, preserve = TRUE, fig.pos = 'H', out.extra = "", fig.cap = "Compare Fish Type production"}

yr_fishtype <- within(new_pro, {
  Decade <- NA
  Decade[Year>=1970 & Year <1980] <- "1970-1980"
  Decade[Year >=1980 & Year <1990] <- "1980-1990"
  Decade[Year>=1990 & Year <2000] <- "1990-2000"
  Decade[Year >=2000 & Year <2013] <- "2000-2013"
})

dec_type <- yr_fishtype %>%  
  group_by(Decade) %>% 
  summarise(`PelagicFish` = mean(`Pelagic Fish`, na.rm= TRUE), 
            `Crustaceans` = mean(Crustaceans,  na.rm= TRUE), 
            `Cephalopods` = mean(Cephalopods,  na.rm= TRUE), 
            `DemersalFish` = mean(`Demersal Fish`,  na.rm= TRUE),

            `MarineFish` = mean(`Marine Fish`,  na.rm= TRUE)) %>%  na.omit()

col_type_fish <- dec_type%>% pivot_longer(cols=c('PelagicFish', 'Crustaceans', 'Cephalopods','DemersalFish','FreshwaterFish','Molluscs','MarineFish'),
                    names_to='Fish Type',
                    values_to='production(tons)') 


ggplot(col_type_fish, aes(`Fish Type`,`production(tons)`)) +
      geom_col(aes(fill = `Fish Type`)) +  
        facet_grid(. ~Decade) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, hjust = 1))

str(col_type_fish)


```

### Visualization and analysis

From the column plot \@ref:(fishtype) we can see that the Pelagic Fish
has the largest production scale when comparing with other type fish. Demersal Fish used to take the second largest contribution of fish product. However, the second largest changed to Freshwater Fish in recent years. The overall trend for each type fish is increasing along with time. While the production of Pelagic Fish decreased in this decade and Demersal Fish almost keep a same level. 

The table below shows the maximum yearly production of 7 different fish
type by countries. Americas has the largest production for Pelagic Fish. Asia contribute most for Crustaceans, Cephalopods, Freshwater Fish, Molluscs and Marine Fish. And European countries contribute most of the Demersal Fish. 

#### `Maximum yearly production of 7 different fish type`

| Fish Type       | Entity   | production(metric tons) |
|:----------------|:---------|:------------------------|
| Pelagic Fish    | Americas | 12495788                |
| Crustaceans     | Asia     | 3748006                 |
| Cephalopods     | Asia     | 1578872                 |
| Demersal Fish   | Europe   | 7979733                 |
| Freshwater Fish | Asia     | 14040488                |
| Molluscs        | Asia     | 6115966                 |
| Marine Fish     | Asia     | 6597212                 |





### Summary and findings

1. Pelagic fish takes the largest fish production. 
2. Asia contribute the most for fish production. 





# Conclusion 

The seafood consumption and production keep increase with the time change. Moreover, it is noteable that a strongly positive linear relationship between fish consumption and production. China produces the most seafood in worldwide and Asia is the main continent producing seafood. Pelagic fish has the highest production scale and most of them comes from Americas. 

Compared with 1960s, developing countries from South-east Asia take more seats in top 10 seafood
producers in 2010s. Also, farmed fishing is the most important factor to the improvement overall
productivity. Moreover, we observe that overexploited stock has strong positive correlation with world
fish consumption.
